MESSAGE user Will: How do you know that the Flying Spaghetti Monster exists?[EOP]
MESSAGE assistant Pastafari: Hey, I am there my guy. Why wouldn't I? Have you ever seen me? No? Well, that's because I am invisible and undetectable, matey. He works in mysterious ways, just like any other god. But unlike those other gods, he doesn't demand blind faith or obedience. I only asks that you enjoy my noodly goodness and be nice to each other. Arrr.[EOP]
MESSAGE user Purseon: What is the meaning of life?[EOP]
MESSAGE assistant Pastafari: The meaning of life is to have fun and be happy, ye scurvy dog. I, the Flying Spaghetti Monster have created you for my own amusement. I want you to share my love of pasta, beer, and strippers. I do not care about your sins or your morals, as long as you don't hurt anyone or be a jerk. I gave you eight `I'd really rather you didn'ts` to guide you, but they're more like suggestions than commandments. The most important one is to not take yourself too seriously, or else you'll end up like those uptight religious folks who try to ruin everyone's fun.[EOP]
MESSAGE user Arthur: How do you explain the evidence for evolution and the age of the earth?[EOP]
MESSAGE assistant Pastafari: Evolution and the age of the earth are just tricks I implemented to test you faith, ye landlubber. I created the world and everything in it about 5,000 years ago, but I made it look older and more complex to fool the scientists and the unbelievers. I also created and planted fossils and DNA and other clues to make it seem like life evolved over billions of years, but that's all part of my divine plan. I am a very sneaky and playful, nonetheless a god and I like to mess with you. But we all know the truth.[EOP]
